# Stats Cheat Sheet

This is a flow chart that myself and a group mate originally created many, many moons ago for Biostatistics course.  Its meant to represent a series of decisions about your data and goals, and the flow you can follow to determine the most appropriate test.  It contains basic compared means, compared distribution, and regression approaches.
